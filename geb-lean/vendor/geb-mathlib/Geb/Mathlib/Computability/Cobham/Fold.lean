# The fold at a carrier with a bit encoding

The catamorphism of a list of bits at a carrier admitting a `p`-bit encoding,
as an instance of the scan combinator. The carrier is arbitrary; its
finiteness enters only through the existence of the encoding, and `dec` is
unconstrained off the image of `enc`.

## Main definitions

* `Cobham.foldStep` — the fold's step, a dispatch on the encoded state.
* `Cobham.foldSem` — the meaning of the scan at the encoded base and the two
  steps.
* `Cobham.fold`, `Cobham.foldOf` — the fold as an expression of `C`, and at
  its declared arity.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.stepWord_foldStep` — the word the step contributes.
* `Cobham.foldSem_nil`, `Cobham.foldSem_cons` — the fold on the empty word and
  on one bit.
* `Cobham.length_foldSem` — every state the fold produces has the encoding's
  width.
* `Cobham.length_foldSem_le` — the growth bound that width gives, in the form
  the scan combinator asks for.
* `Cobham.foldSem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at the raw tree is the meaning
  the expression carries.
* `Cobham.foldSem_eq` — the fold computes the carrier-level fold, encoded.

## Implementation notes

Neither the encoding-to-word nor the carrier-level fold is named: they are
`List.ofFn (enc a)` and `w.foldr step init`, spelled at the length a name
would cost. The two sides of `foldSem_eq` inhabit different types before
`List.ofFn ∘ enc` is applied, so the encoding is applied rather than the two
equated.

`foldr` is the fold `Cobham.scanSem_eq` presents the scan as, and the
direction `Cobham.evalRec` recurses in. The statement is over the Lean list on
both sides, so no convention about which end of the word the list's head
denotes enters it.

`length_foldSem` and the bound `length_foldSem_le` that weakens it precede the
retraction hypothesis and do not take it: every state the scan produces is a
`List.ofFn` of an `enc` value — the base by `baseWord_constAtOf`, each step by
`stepWord_constAtOf` — so its length is the encoding's width whatever `dec`
does. Consequently `fold`, `foldOf` and `foldSem_eq_eval` take no retraction
hypothesis either.

The carrier `α` carries no `Fintype` or `FinEnum` instance; its finiteness
enters only through `enc`. The module takes no decision and carries no
`Decidable` instance, so
`DecidableEq (Fin p → Bool)`, which resolves through
`Fintype.decidablePiFintype` and depends on `Classical.choice`, does not
arise; a consumer deciding an equality of states decides it over `List Bool`,
the states already being `List.ofFn` values.
