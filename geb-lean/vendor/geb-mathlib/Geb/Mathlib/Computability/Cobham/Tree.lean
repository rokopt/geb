# The preorder stack scan in Cobham's class

An expression of `C` computing, in a single right-to-left pass over a
bitstring, the stack depth of the word read as the preorder spelling of a
term of `RankedAlphabet.Binary.binRanked`, together with the scan's
liveness verdict. The two are carried in one recursive value, told apart
by its head: while no node bit has been read below depth two the value is
the depth in unary offset by one, so its head is `true`; once one has
been, the value is `[false]`, which the node step reproduces, that
value's two predecessors being empty. Each bit is read once.

The recursion is a `boundedRec` node, so admissibility requires a bound: the
scan's value is never longer than the recursion variable by more than one bit,
which the scanner's bound child expresses at growth one. That is the side
condition of bounded recursion on notation [Cobham1965], and discharging it is
what places the scan in `C` rather than merely in the syntax `sig` describes.

The one-test on the scan's predecessor is the recognizer, correct against the
`Valid` predicate of the encoding. Composed with
`RankedAlphabet.valid_iff_exists_spell`,
`isTreeSem_eq_singleton_iff_exists_spell` states that an expression of `C`
accepts exactly the spellings of terms.
`isTreeSem_eq_ite` pins its value on the rejecting branch as well: the two
`iff` statements alone do not imply it, since a recognizer returning
`[false]` rather than `[]` on a rejected word would satisfy both while
disagreeing with `isTreeSem_eq_ite` there, so the correctness the latter
states is a property of the function and not only of the accepted set.

`isTree_smashFree` places `isTree` in the subalgebra `SmashFree` names,
`[ε, I, s₀, s₁, ∗; COMP, BRN]`; with [Strahm2003] Theorem 1(2), deciding
`RankedAlphabet.Valid` at `RankedAlphabet.Binary.binRanked` is computable
simultaneously in polynomial time and linear space.

## Main definitions

* `Cobham.oneAt`, `Cobham.falseAt` — the one-bit strings at an arbitrary
  arity.
* `Cobham.inc` — prepending `true`, of arity one.
* `Cobham.predPred` — the argument with two bits dropped, of arity one.
* `Cobham.combFalseStep`, `Cobham.combTrueStep` — the leaf step and the node
  step of the scan, of arity one.
* `Cobham.comb` — the stack depth and the underflow verdict in one value, of
  arity one.
* `Cobham.eqOneInner` — whether the predecessor of the argument is empty, of
  arity one.
* `Cobham.eqOne` — whether a bitstring has length one, of arity one.
* `Cobham.isTree` — the recognizer, of arity one.
* `Cobham.combSem`, `Cobham.eqOneSem`, `Cobham.isTreeSem` — the meaning of
  the scan, the length test and the recognizer at its arity, over which
  every statement of the module is stated.

Every expression is given as a raw tree `…Raw` and as the expression `…` of `C`
carrying admissibility. The ascription `…Of` at the reduced arity is given
for the scan, the length test and the recognizer, matching the interface
`BellantoniCook.comb`, `BellantoniCook.eqOne` and `BellantoniCook.isTree`
present, and for an expression whose reduced arity a proof reads.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.combSem_def` — the scan's meaning is the scanner's, at the two
  steps.
* `Cobham.combSem_nil`, `Cobham.combSem_cons_false`,
  `Cobham.combSem_cons_true` — the scan unfolded at each constructor of the
  recursion variable, with the recursive value exposed.
* `Cobham.combSem_eq` — the scan computes `RankedAlphabet.Binary.depth` in
  unary, offset by one, while `RankedAlphabet.Binary.ok` holds, and `[false]`
  once it has failed.
* `Cobham.length_combSem_le` — the recursion bound `scan` asks for, which
  `comb`, `combOf` and `combSem_eq_eval` each pass to the scanner.
* `Cobham.combSem_eq_eval`, `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at
  the raw tree is the meaning the expression of `C` carries.
* `Cobham.eqOneSem_env` — the one-test at an arbitrary environment is the
  test at the canonical one.
* `Cobham.eqOneSem_eq` — `eqOne` accepts exactly the bitstrings of length
  one.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_apply` — one step of the recognizer: the one-test on
  the scan's predecessor.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_ite` — the recognizer's value on both branches:
  `[true]` on a word `binRanked`'s scan accepts and `[]` on every other.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_singleton_iff_valid` — `isTree` accepts exactly the
  words `binRanked`'s scan accepts.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_singleton_iff_exists_spell` — equivalently, exactly
  the spellings of `binRanked`'s terms.
* `Cobham.isTree_smashFree` — the recognizer lies in the subalgebra
  `SmashFree` names.

## Implementation notes

Each raw tree is named apart from the expression built on it because instance
search finds `Decidable (sig.WValid w)` when `w` is a constant but not when it
is a literal `WType.mk` application, so `decide` discharges admissibility only
of a named tree. `oneAtRaw` and `falseAtRaw` carry a free arity, at which
`decide` does not apply; their admissibility is the pair of an
`Unit ⊕ Fin m` case analysis and the `funext` that the index condition asks
for. The admissibility of an expression embedding `pred` or `cond` reuses that
expression's own component rather than repeating its proof.

`combSem` is the meaning read at the raw tree rather than at `comb`.
`Cobham.eval` asks only for admissibility as a `sig`-tree, not for the
recursion bound, so the scan is characterized by `combSem_eq` before the
expression carrying that bound exists. The bound is then that characterization
together with `RankedAlphabet.Binary.depth_le_length`: the value is `[false]`,
of length one, or the depth in unary offset by one, and the depth never
exceeds the word length, while the scanner's bound child, at growth one,
returns one bit more than the recursion variable. `combSem` is the scanner's
meaning at its arity, and `combSem_eq_eval` reads it back through `C.eval`, as
`isTreeSem_eq_eval` does for the recognizer.

That bound is a bound on the value `combSem` produces at each step, not a
bound on the cost of evaluating the expression that computes it: nothing in
this module measures a number of reduction steps or an amount of space
consumed while doing so. `isTree_smashFree` states only that `isTree` avoids
the `smash` generator; the polynomial-time, linear-space reading of that
membership is [Strahm2003] Theorem 1(2), cited and not reproved here.

`cond` and `pred` are `boundedRec` nodes in this algebra rather than
generators, so a step's meaning reduces only once the value it scrutinizes is
in constructor form: `combSem_cons_false` and `combSem_cons_true` are
therefore not definitional. Each is a corollary of `scanSem_cons`, proved by
rewriting to the step's own application at the recursive value, generalizing
that value, and matching on it. The node step's guard drops two bits through
two `pred` nodes, each of which peels a bit only at a literal, so the match
reaches the fourth constructor layer of the value.

`combSem` names the meaning at the reduced arity, so that rewriting under it
type-checks. A meaning taken through the `Sigma` projection instead has a type
headed by that projection rather than by an arrow, and `rw` under it fails as
not type-correct at `implicit` transparency.

`eqOne` and `isTree` are `comp` compositions of `pred`, `cond` and `comb`,
carrying no `boundedRec` node of their own, so each admissibility obligation
is discharged by the anonymous constructor pairing the node's own condition,
vacuous at a `comp`, with a case analysis over its children, reusing the
embedded subexpression's own `RecBounded` component rather than repeating its
proof. Unlike a primitive predecessor shape, `pred` here is itself a
`boundedRec` node (`predRaw`), so its value on the scan's result does not
reduce on a symbolic word: `isTreeSem_apply` is proved by rewriting to the
composition's own application, generalizing the scan's value, and matching
on it, rather than by `rfl`.

The meanings this module reads at a raw tree are taken through `Cobham.semAt`,
which names the composite of `fst_eval` with the tree's arity equation once
rather than spelling it at each site.
