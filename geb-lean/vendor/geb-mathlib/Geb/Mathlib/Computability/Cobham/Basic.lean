# Cobham's class of bitstring functions

The syntax of a Cobham-style function algebra on bitstrings, whose recursion scheme
is bounded recursion on notation [Cobham1965], together with its interpretation over
every `sig`-tree. Terms are built from a constant zero, projections, two successors,
a smash and a concat generator, and are closed under a composition and a bounded
recursion. [HeraudNowak2011]'s grammar for `C` (`O | Πⁱₙ | S_b | # | Compⁿ | Rec`) has
no concatenation generator; the `concat` generator here is added, grounded in
[Strahm2003]'s operator list `[ε, I, s₀, s₁, ∗; COMP, BRN]`, and is what makes the
smash-free bound `SmashFree` names expressible at all. `sig` fixes the shape of the
syntax alone — each constructor's arity and the arity relation its subterms must
satisfy — and `eval` gives the meaning of any tree respecting that relation. Cobham's
class itself is the subtype `C` of trees whose recursions additionally respect the
length bound the scheme imposes, carrying `eval` down to `C.eval`.

A bitstring is `List Bool`, its head the word's last bit. `succ b` — `S_b` in
[HeraudNowak2011]'s notation, `s₀`/`s₁` in [Strahm2003]'s — prepends by consing `b`.
`boundedRec`'s recursion `evalRec` — [HeraudNowak2011]'s `Rec` — peels that head at
each step, passing the remaining bitstring on as the new recursion variable. `concat`
— `∗` in [Strahm2003]'s list — reads its second argument as the earlier part of the
word and its first as the later part, `fun x ↦ x 1 ++ x 0`, consistent with the same
convention.

`SmashFree` names the subalgebra `[ε, I, s₀, s₁, ∗; COMP, BRN]`, which [Strahm2003]
Theorem 1(2) contains in the functions computable simultaneously in polynomial time
and linear space, a characterization [Strahm2003] attributes to [Thompson1972] and
[Strahm2010] Theorem 5 restates. [Clote1999] Theorem 3.20 gives an arithmetic
analogue over the naturals. Linear space alone is the second Grzegorczyk class
[Ritchie1963] (via [Clote1999] Theorem 3.36 and its Corollary 3.37), the class
Bellantoni's safe recursion also characterizes [Bellantoni1992] (via [Clote1999]
Theorem 3.101).

  expression.

* `Cobham.diag`, `Cobham.diagOf` — a binary expression at its sole argument in
  both positions.
* `Cobham.concatCompRaw` — the concatenation of two raw trees of a common arity.
* `Cobham.condRaw` / `Cobham.cond` — the four-way conditional, as a raw tree and as
  an expression of arity four.
* `Cobham.condSem` — the meaning of the conditional.
* `Cobham.smashFreeBool` — whether no `smash` node occurs anywhere in a raw tree.

  the `smash` generator.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.transport_transport` — transport along a composite equality is
  the composition of two transports.
* `Cobham.fst_eval` — the index component of a tree's interpretation is its arity.
* `Cobham.recBounded_mk` — `RecBounded` unfolded one level, on a raw node.
* `Cobham.predSem_eq` — the predecessor drops the word's last bit.

  `Cobham.recBounded_predIterRaw` — the iterated predecessor's arity,
  admissibility and recursion bound.
* `Cobham.wIndexRoot_prependRaw`, `Cobham.wValid_prependRaw`,
  `Cobham.recBounded_prependRaw` — prepending preserves the arity,
  admissibility and the recursion bound.

  `Cobham.recBounded_diagRaw` — the diagonal's arity, admissibility and
  recursion bound.
* `Cobham.condSem_eq` — the conditional branches on the emptiness and parity of its
  first argument.

## Implementation notes

Every `def` in this module is `@[expose]`, so a wrapper module and the tests can
unfold them across the module boundary; the `sigFinitary` instance, the
`Decidable (SmashFree ·)` instance, and the theorems need no such tag.

`concatRaw` and `smashRaw` are named apart from the expressions built on them
because instance search finds `Decidable (sig.WValid w)` when `w` is a constant but
not when it is a literal `WType.mk` application, with or without an ascription, so
`decide` discharges admissibility only of a named tree.

`Direction`, `rc` and `q` are `@[reducible]`. Instance search does not delta-reduce a
semireducible definition, and `sigFinitary` resolves `FinEnum (sig.B a)` against the
literal `Direction a` each branch produces.

`sigFinitary`'s `comp` branch resolves `FinEnum (Unit ⊕ Fin m)` through the
choice-free `FinEnum.unit` and `FinEnum.finSum`, and its other branches resolve
`FinEnum (Fin n)` through the choice-free `FinEnum.finFin`. Those instances are
`scoped` in `namespace FinEnum`; this module's `open scoped FinEnum` is required for
them to win resolution over mathlib's `Classical.choice`-dependent counterparts,
which `lake lint` rejects.

`evalValue` is a separate definition from `evalStep` because the match on `Shape`
must generalize the compatibility hypothesis, which arrives bundled in
`SliceDomPFunctor.Obj`. A child's meaning carries the index it was built at rather
than the index `rc` prescribes, equal but not definitionally so; `transport` carries
it across, with the motive of `▸` fixed once instead of at each use site.
`evalValue`'s `boundedRec` clause does not consult its bound child's meaning: the
bound is a side condition on admissibility, imposed by `RecBoundedValue`, not part
of a tree's value.

`eval` is a slice morphism, so the index it returns agrees with `arity` only by
`SlicePFunctor.W.comp_elim`, a `funext` theorem; `C.eval` is therefore
`transport (fst_eval _) (eval _).2` rather than the second projection alone, and the
index equation `RecBoundedValue` consumes is the node's compatibility composed with
`fst_eval`. `recBounded_mk` is stated on the raw `⟨WType.mk a f, _⟩` rather than on
`SlicePFunctor.W.mk`, at which the `WType.rec` of `RecProp` iota-reduces and the
unfolding is definitional; the index equation is a hypothesis, definitional proof
irrelevance making the choice of proof term immaterial. `C.arity` and `C.eval`
qualify `arity` and `eval` because the namespace of the declaration being elaborated
is in scope, which would otherwise make each body self-referential.

`zeroAtRaw` carries a free arity, at which `decide` does not apply; its
admissibility is the pair of an `Unit ⊕ Fin m` case analysis and the `funext`
the index condition asks for.

[Strahm2003]'s last-argument form. The base case is the empty bitstring; a step
consumes the low bit `b`, passes the remaining bitstring `v` as the new recursion
variable, and passes the recursive value alongside it. -/

The bitstring generators read the ambient environment directly, `Direction` being
`Fin 0` for each: `zero` returns the empty bitstring; `proj n i` returns the `i`th
argument; `succ b` prepends `b` to the argument. `smash` and `concat` are Cobham's
two generators: `smash` marks its result with a leading `true`, so
`|#(a, b)| = |a| · |b| + 1`; `concat` reads its second argument as the earlier part
of the word and its first as the later part, consistent with the list head
representing the word's last bit. `comp` applies its head's meaning to the argument
expressions' meanings, each read at the ambient environment. `boundedRec` performs
`evalRec` on its recursion variable, its base and two step children supplying `g`,
`h₀` and `h₁`. -/

peels the word's last bit, so `Π⁴₅` is the step taken on a last bit `0` and `Π³₅`
the step taken on a last bit `1`; the base is taken on the empty word.

The bound child departs from [HeraudNowak2011], which takes `#(S₁x, #(S₁y, S₁z))`
over the three branch arguments, the `S₁` wrappers keeping the smash's length
product away from zero at the empty word. The smash generator is excluded from the
subalgebra `SmashFree` names, so the bound here is instead the concatenation of the
same three arguments, of length `|x| + |y| + |z|`, which dominates each of them at
