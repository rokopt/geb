# The generic ranked recognizer

The validity scan of `Geb/Mathlib/Data/Tree/Ranked/Preorder.lean`, at an
arbitrary ranked alphabet, composed with a verdict test into a recognizer, as
an expression of Cobham's class.

## Main definitions

* `Cobham.bufBits` — the incomplete block in a slot of the alphabet's width.
* `Cobham.stateWord` — the scan state as a bitstring.
* `Cobham.dispatchWidth` — the number of state bits a step dispatches on.
* `Cobham.decodeState` — the inverse of the state layout.
* `Cobham.dropCount`, `Cobham.nextPrefix` — the bits a step drops and
  prepends.
* `Cobham.rankedStep`, `Cobham.rankedSem` — the recognizer's step and the
  meaning of its scan.
* `Cobham.ranked`, `Cobham.rankedOf` — the scan as an expression of `C`, and
  at its declared arity.
* `Cobham.acceptWord`, `Cobham.acceptTest` — the accepting state's word and
  the test deciding it.
* `Cobham.isRankedRaw`, `Cobham.isRanked`, `Cobham.isRankedOf`,
  `Cobham.isRankedSem` — the recognizer's raw tree, the expression of `C` over
  it, that expression at its declared arity, and its meaning.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.length_bufBits_of_lt`, `Cobham.length_stateWord_of_lt` — the slot's
  and the state word's lengths.
* `Cobham.dropWhile_bufBits` — the slot past its padding.
* `Cobham.ofFn_bits_stateWord` — the state word truncated to a window and
  zero-padded.
* `Cobham.decodeState_stateWord_of_lt` — the decoder inverts the layout up to
  capping the pending count at the depth window.
* `Cobham.dropCount_min_depth`, `Cobham.nextPrefix_min_depth` — capping the
  pending count at the depth window changes neither.
* `Cobham.stateWord_scanStep_of_lt` — a step rewrites a bounded prefix and
  drops a bounded number of bits.
* `Cobham.stepWord_rankedStep_of_lt`, `Cobham.rankedSem_eq` — the expression
  computes the scan, one step and then on every input.
* `Cobham.length_rankedSem_le` — the recursion bound the scanner asks for.
* `Cobham.rankedSem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at the raw tree is the meaning
  the expression carries.
* `Cobham.ofFn_bits_stateWord_eq_iff` — the verdict window separates the
  accepting state from every other reachable one.
* `Cobham.stepWord_acceptTest` — the test's value at the state it reads.
* `Cobham.wValid_isRankedRaw` — the raw tree's admissibility, from its two
  components'.
* `Cobham.isRankedSem_apply`, `Cobham.isRankedSem_eq_ite` — the composition's
  value, and the value on both branches.
* `Cobham.isRankedSem_eq_singleton_iff_valid` — the recognizer accepts exactly
  the words spelling a term.
* `Cobham.isRankedSem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at the raw tree is the
  meaning the expression carries.
* `Cobham.isRankedSem_binRanked_eq_singleton_iff_isTreeSem` — at the
  two-symbol alphabet it accepts the language `Cobham.isTree` accepts.

## Implementation notes

`RankedAlphabet.Scan` carries an incomplete block, a count of pending
subterms, and a liveness flag. The count is unbounded and the other two are
not, and an expression of the class reaches only a bounded prefix of a word,
so the count is the tail and the layout admits no alternative.

The block cannot be delimited by its own length, since the fields after it
would then stand at a position not statically known. It occupies a slot of
exactly `R.width` bits, delimited by a `true` sentinel preceded by `false`
padding: reading from offset one, past the flag, the first `true` is the
sentinel and the block is what follows it, the padding being all `false`. The
slot's length is invariant under accumulation — the padding shrinks as the
block grows — which is why the fields after it never move. This costs
`R.width` bits rather than the `2 * R.width` a separate fill counter would.

`length_bufBits_of_lt`'s hypothesis is consumed rather than decorative. `Nat`
subtraction being truncated, a block of length `R.width` or more yields a slot
of length one past the block, and `stateWord` is then not injective: at
`R.width = 2` the states `⟨[false, true], 0, true⟩` and `⟨[false], 1, true⟩`
share the word `[true, true, false, true]`. The invariant excluding this is
`RankedAlphabet.length_buf_scanFinal_lt`.

The pending count is unary. Binary would need a truncated subtraction
definable in the class, and `Cobham/Tree.lean`'s recognizer represents its own
depth in unary already.

`ofFn_bits_stateWord` is stated at an arbitrary window, the dispatch and the
verdict reading different ones.

The branch family's domain is `Fin (dispatchWidth R) → Bool` at a symbolic
width, so recovering the fields index by index would carry a bound proof at
every step. `decodeState` avoids that by passing through `List.ofFn` and
reading the fields with the `List` API. This also keeps the module clear of
`DecidableEq (Fin n → Bool)`, which resolves through
`Fintype.decidablePiFintype`, measured as depending on `Classical.choice`,
while `DecidableEq (List Bool)` measures clean.

The run of `false` past the slot is cleared by a two-case reduction rather
than by `List.takeWhile_replicate`, which was measured to depend on
`Classical.choice` through `List.filter_replicate`. A proof shortened back
onto that lemma fails `lake lint`.

The dispatch reads the flag and the slot together with the low
`R.maxArity + 1` bits of the pending count, which give
`min depth (R.maxArity + 1)`. Those bits decide `r ≤ depth` for every symbol:
if the count is at least `R.maxArity + 1` then every arity is below it, and
otherwise those bits are the count itself.
`RankedAlphabet.le_maxArity_of_arOf_eq_some` is what makes the window
sufficient, and it is what `dropCount_min_depth` and `nextPrefix_min_depth`
consume.

Neither `SmashFree (ranked R)` nor `SmashFree (isRanked R)` is stated here.
`smashFreeBool` is a `WType.elim` over the whole tree, so at a symbolic
alphabet it is not `decide`-dischargeable and needs a recursion mirroring
`wValid_casesRaw`, and at a concrete alphabet it forces every node. Nothing in
this module uses `smash`, so the statement is expected to hold and is left to
the branch that needs it. `Cobham/Tree.lean` keeps `comb` and
`isTree`, so `isTree_smashFree` and the [Strahm2003] Theorem 1(2) reasoning
keep their subject.

No equivalence here is discharged by `omega`, which pulls `Classical.choice`
on an `Iff` goal; each is built from its two implications or from
`Iff.trans`.

`isRankedSem_eq_ite` pins the value on the rejecting branch as well as the
accepting one. `isRankedSem_eq_singleton_iff_valid` alone would admit a
recognizer returning `[false]` on a rejected word, so correctness as a
function is not implied by correctness of the accepted set.

The containment this module realizes is an instance of Cobham's
characterisation of the polynomial-time functions; what it delivers is an
explicit expression computing the decision, not a new theorem.
