# The scan combinator over Cobham's class

A scanner is a right-to-left fold over a bitstring whose state is itself a
bitstring: a base value, one step per bit read, and a bound on how far the
state can exceed the input. `Cobham.evalRec` supplies the recursion, peeling
the word's last bit at each step and passing the rest of the word on; the
state is the recursive value it passes alongside.

`evalRec` applies its step to `Fin.cons v (Fin.cons (ih x) x)`: slot zero is
the rest of the word, slot one the recursive value, slots two upward the
ambient environment. A fold's step is a function of the state alone, so a
scanner's steps are `COf 1`, lifted into the shape `evalRec` applies by
composition with `proj 2 1`.

## Main definitions

* `Cobham.boundRaw` — the bound child, `succ true` iterated over `proj 1 0`.
* `Cobham.liftRaw` — a step of arity one in `evalRec`'s step shape.
* `Cobham.scanRaw` — the `boundedRec` node over a base, two lifted steps and
  a bound child.
* `Cobham.scanW` — that node over expressions, carrying admissibility.
* `Cobham.boundSem`, `Cobham.scanSem` — the meanings of the bound child and
  of the scan, at arity one.
* `Cobham.baseWord`, `Cobham.stepWord`, `Cobham.scanStepWord` — the words a
  base and a step contribute, and the semantic step of the fold.
* `Cobham.scan`, `Cobham.scanOf` — the scanner as an expression of `C`, and
  at its declared arity.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.wValid_boundRaw`, `Cobham.wValid_liftRaw`, `Cobham.wValid_scanRaw`
  — admissibility of the three trees, the last from its components'.
* `Cobham.wIndexRoot_boundRaw`, `Cobham.wIndexRoot_liftRaw`,
  `Cobham.arity_boundRaw`, `Cobham.arity_scanW` — their arities.
* `Cobham.boundSem_eq` — the bound child prepends `growth` bits.
* `Cobham.scanSem_nil`, `Cobham.scanSem_cons`, `Cobham.scanSem_eq` — the
  scan on the empty word, on one bit, and as a `List.foldr`.
* `Cobham.baseWord_eq_eval`, `Cobham.stepWord_eq_eval` — each component's
  word is the one its expression of `C` carries.
* `Cobham.recBounded_boundRaw`, `Cobham.recBounded_liftRaw` — the bound child
  and a lifted step carry no recursion of their own.
* `Cobham.scanSem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at the raw tree is the meaning
  the expression carries.

## Implementation notes

Admissibility of a node requires the children's index equations alongside
their own admissibility, `SlicePFunctor.wValid_mk` constraining
`wIndexRoot ∘ children`; that is where the raw layer and the expression
layer meet, and it is why `wValid_scanRaw` takes six hypotheses rather than
three. The equations are stated through
`SlicePFunctor.wIndexValid_index_eq_wIndexRoot`, the goal presenting the
index as `WIndex.index ∘ wIndexValid` rather than as `wIndexRoot`.

`decide` discharges none of these: at a variable child nothing reduces. It
remains available at a named constant, which is what the instances built on
this module use.

A child family indexed by `Fin 4` is bound as `fun d : Fin 4 ↦ …`. Instance
search stops at reducible transparency on the projection `sig.B a`, so
without the ascription a numeral index fails to elaborate.

Each component's meaning is transported along the composition of `fst_eval`
with the component's arity equation, in one step rather than two.
`transport` along an equation whose sides reduce to the same literal
disappears by proof irrelevance; along an opaque equation it does not, and a
transport along a composite equality is then not definitionally the
composition of two transports. The scan node's own arity reduces to one
whatever its children are, so its transport disappears; a component's arity
equation is `base.2` or `step.2` at a variable, which reduces to nothing.
The composed form is what keeps `scanSem_nil` a `rfl` and lets
`scanSem_cons`'s `change` land, at the price of making the two bridges to
`C.eval` theorems rather than definitions.

`scanSem_cons` is not definitional in its last step: the lifted step applies
its head at `fun _ : Fin 1 ↦ r`, while `stepWord` applies it at `![r]`, and
the two agree only by `funext`.

The meanings this module reads at a raw tree are taken through `Cobham.semAt`,
which names the composite of `fst_eval` with the tree's arity equation once
rather than spelling it at each site.
