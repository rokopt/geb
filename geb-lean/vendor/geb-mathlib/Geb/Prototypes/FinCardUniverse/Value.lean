# Prototype: what the universe functor computes over a non-discrete base

Throwaway exploration, not upstream-eligible content. Every declaration here is
`Classical.choice`-free.

`Basic` builds the universe endofunctor over a base of finite sets with all
functions between them as morphisms. This module computes its value on a family
of codes and records what the computation shows.

A family of codes `(U, d : U → Card)` — an object of the free coproduct
completion `Fam(Card)` — becomes the presheaf `famPresheaf U d`, the coproduct
of representables `Σ_u y(d u)`. The p.r.a. formula then reads the functor's
value at that presheaf off the arity homs, and `arityHomEquiv` computes them:
an arity hom for the shape at a code former is a choice, for each
summand `k` of its arity, of a code `u` together with a morphism `bound k ⟶ d u`.

That morphism is where the two presentations part. The inductive-recursive
presentation of the same universe
(`Geb/Mathlib/Data/PFunctor/IndRec/Universes.lean`) works over `Type` treated as
discrete, so its corresponding datum is an equality: the bound code's decoding
*is* the declared object. Over a base with morphisms the equality relaxes to a
coercion, and `junkArity` exhibits a consequence: a binder shape declaring the
empty object accepts a code denoting the singleton. Since a shape's output index
is fixed by the shape (`out_emptyBind`), the code so formed decodes by its
declaration rather than by its children — the recursion of induction-recursion
is decoupled.

The relaxation is not a defect of the encoding but the price of functoriality.
`piFormer_not_covariant` reproduces, at this scale, the obstruction of Example
3.6 of [GhaniNordvallForsbergMalatesta2015]: the dependent-product former admits
no covariant action on the base's morphisms, while `sigmaFormer_covariant` shows
the dependent-sum former does at the same instance. The universe functor of
`Basic` is nonetheless total in the type former — `sigmaUniverse` and
`piUniverse` differ only in the shape-output map — precisely because the
declared decoding it carries is not required to match the decodings of its
children.

## Main definitions

* `famPresheaf` — a family of codes as a presheaf, the coproduct of
  representables `Σ_u y(d u)`.
* `arityHomEquiv` — the arity homs into such a presheaf: one code and one
  coercion per arity summand.
* `oneFam` / `emptyBindCode` / `junkShape` / `junkArity` / `junkObj` — the family
  with one code denoting the singleton, the binder code declaring the empty
  object, and the element of the functor's value that binds the one against the
  other.
* `counterFam` / `counterMap` / `counterFamReindexed` — the data of Example 3.6.

## Main statements

* `junk_decoding_ne` — the bound code's decoding differs from the object the
  shape declares, so the arity hom has no inductive-recursive counterpart.
* `out_emptyBind` — the shape's output object is fixed by the declaration.
* `sigmaFormer_covariant` / `piFormer_not_covariant` — Example 3.6 at this
  scale.

/-! ## Families as presheaves -/

/-- A family of codes as a presheaf: the coproduct of representables
`Σ_u y(d u)`. This is the embedding of the free coproduct completion `Fam(Card)`
into `PSh(Card)`; its fiber over `c` is not the codes decoding to `c` but the
codes admitting a morphism from `c`. -/
def famPresheaf (U : Type) (d : U → Card) : Cardᵒᵖ ⥤ Type where
  obj c := Σ u : U, (c.unop ⟶ d u)
  map f := ↾ fun x ↦ (⟨x.1, f.unop ≫ x.2⟩ : Σ u : U, (_ ⟶ d u))
  map_id _ := rfl
  map_comp _ _ := rfl

/-! ## The arity homs -/

/-- The arity homs into a family presheaf: an arity hom for the shape `a` is a
choice, for each arity summand `k`, of a code `u` together with a morphism
`bound k ⟶ d u`. Forward is evaluation at the summands' universal directions and backward is
precomposition, the two round trips being Yoneda.

The morphism is the point of the computation. The inductive-recursive
presentation over a discrete base has an equality `bound k = d u` here; over a
base with morphisms no arity can ask for that, since a direction constrains the
index of the value it receives and the index of a value in a family presheaf is
not its code's decoding. -/
def arityHomEquiv (former : Former) (a : Shp former) (U : Type) (d : U → Card) :
    ArityHom (universeFunctor former) a (famPresheaf U d) ≃
      ((k : Idx a.1) → Σ u : U, (bound a.1 k ⟶ d u)) where
  toFun α k := α.1 (bound a.1 k) ⟨⟨k, bound a.1 k, 𝟙 _⟩, rfl⟩
  invFun F :=
    ⟨fun _i b ↦ ⟨(F b.1.1).1, (eqToHom b.2.symm ≫ b.1.2.2) ≫ (F b.1.1).2⟩,

supplies, where the inductive-recursive presentation would demand `⟨1⟩ = ⟨0⟩`.

/-! ## Example 3.6 at this scale

The obstruction to interpreting the dependent-product universe over a base with

the singleton to the empty object. This is Example 3.6 of
[GhaniNordvallForsbergMalatesta2015] at the smallest scale that hosts it. -/

from the singleton to the empty object. What the dependent-product former's
action needs is exactly such a section, which is the subject of
`Geb/Prototypes/UniverseVariance.lean`. -/
