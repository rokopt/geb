# The term algebra's destructor in the fold's language

The inverse of the initial algebra's structure map, as expressions of
Cobham's class, at the representation `RankedAlphabet.spell` fixes.

`codeOf` and `dropCodeOf` read a word's leading block and what follows it,
through a constant unary prefix that makes the word a self-delimiting entry
whose payload is that block, so no dispatch over the block is needed.

`algPara` is the paramorphism as a fold, at a carrier pairing a subterm's
spelling with the step's value, the value delimited so the two are separable.
The delimiting does not nest: each level reads only the spelling half of a
child's value, so a subterm's boundary is reached by a fold rather than at
the cost a nested encoding would carry. `WType.para` already exists, so no
recursion scheme is introduced here; `algPara` is the encoding at which it is
computed, and `algPara_eq_para` identifies the two.

Under the preorder encoding the structure map is the identity on
representations, `RankedAlphabet.spell_mk` stating that a symbol's block
followed by its children's spellings is the spelling of the term they build.
The content of the inverse laws is therefore that a valid word determines the
symbol and the children's spellings.

## Main definitions

* `Geb.CobhamFold.codeOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.dropCodeOf` — the block reader and
  its complement.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.ParaStep`, `Geb.CobhamFold.algPara` — the paramorphism's
  step, and the paramorphism as a fold.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.algCh` — the delimited-children algebra, one instance of
  the paramorphism.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.chGrowth` — the per-symbol growth the delimited-children
  algebra meets under its own invariant.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.algChOf` — that algebra as an expression of the class.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.chFoldOf` — the delimited-children fold as an expression.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.childSem`, `Geb.CobhamFold.childOf` — a child's spelling,
  read from a fold's value and read by an expression.

## Main statements

* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_codeOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_dropCodeOf` —
  what those two compute at an arbitrary word.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_codeOf_spell_mk`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_dropCodeOf_spell_mk` — what they recover from a
  spelling.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.dropEntry_algPara` — the value's second half is the
  spelling, whatever the step.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.takeEntry_algPara` — the paramorphism's defining equation.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.algPara_eq_para` — it is `WType.para` at the step that sees
  each child's spelling in place of the subtree.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.sum_ofFn_length_eq_length_flatten`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.growth_algPara` — a family's total length, and the
  per-symbol growth a bounded step gives.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.dropEntry_algCh`, `Geb.CobhamFold.takeEntry_algCh` — the
  paramorphism's two laws at `Geb.CobhamFold.algCh`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.length_algCh`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.five_mul_length_dropEntrySem_algCh_le` — its length at
  arbitrary arguments, and the bound its outputs satisfy.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.growth_algCh_of_dropEntrySem_le`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stackSize_algCh_le` — the per-symbol growth condition at
  `Geb.CobhamFold.algCh`, and the linearity hypothesis it discharges.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.length_fold_algCh_le` — that fold's value at a term is
  linear in the term, the linearity in the input word read at a spelling.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.semAt_algChOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.smashFreeBool_algChOf` —
  what `Geb.CobhamFold.algChOf` computes, and that it carries no `smash`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.takeEntrySem_cons_true` — the presence marker is absorbed
  into the entry's unary prefix, so one further bit is read from what follows
  the entry.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.fold_algCh_mk` — the fold's value at a constructed term.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.childSem_mk`, `Geb.CobhamFold.childSem_of_le`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_childOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_childOf_of_le` — the child reader recovers a
  child's spelling and is total.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.smashFreeBool_chFoldOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.smashFreeBool_childOf` — the fold and the child reader
  carry no `smash`, which is what `Cobham.SmashFree` names.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.toSigma_mk` — the term algebra's destructor at the
  `RankedAlphabet.Term.mk` presentation.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.semAt_mkOf_spell` — the constructor's expression at the
  children's spellings is the spelling of the term they build.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.semAt_mkOf_childOf` — the constructor at the children the
  destructor reads returns the word.

## Implementation notes

`algCh` does not meet the per-symbol growth condition
`Geb.CobhamFold.stackSize_le_of_growth` consumes, and not because
`dropEntrySem` fails to shrink — `length_dropEntrySem_le` bounds its result
by its argument. It duplicates its children's payloads, delimited and plain,
so its length is bounded by a multiple of the children's total rather than by
that total plus a constant. A multiplicative condition alone would not give
the linearity hypothesis either, a fold whose values multiply at every level
being exponential in depth. The route taken instead is
`five_mul_length_dropEntrySem_algCh_le`, a property of the algebra's own
outputs that needs no induction hypothesis,
carried along the scan by `mem_stack_foldScanFinal` and consumed by a
potential argument in the shape
`Geb.CobhamFold.potential_foldScanStep_le_of_invariant`'s.

`Variable.lean` states the potential chain at a growth condition restricted
to values satisfying a predicate the scan's stack carries, and derives the
unrestricted forms from it at the trivial predicate. The restriction is what
`algCh` needs and what the unrestricted condition does not give.

`Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutExprV`'s readout emits `Geb.CobhamFold.outWordV`,
which prefixes a presence marker. The marker is absorbed into the entry's
unary prefix rather than left beside it, so one further bit is read from what
follows the entry. Each equation is therefore stated in the "entries followed
by an arbitrary remainder" form, which `takeEntrySem` at an `entryWord`
tolerates, and the case past the last child is proved against that extra bit
rather than in its absence.
