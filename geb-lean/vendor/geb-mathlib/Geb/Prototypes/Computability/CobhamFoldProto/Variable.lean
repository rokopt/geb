# The fold at a bitstring carrier

`Geb/Prototypes/Computability/CobhamFoldProto/Expr.lean` folds at a carrier with a
fixed-width bit encoding, dispatching each step on a constant window that holds
the whole stack the step reads. This module folds at the carrier `List Bool`
with the algebra's operations supplied as expressions of Cobham's class, so the
carrier is unrestricted and the algebra is whatever the class can define.

## Main definitions

* `Geb.CobhamFold.stackWordV`, `Geb.CobhamFold.stateWordV` — the stack and the
  state as bitstrings.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stackSize` — the total length of the pending values.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.entryWordOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.applyAlgOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.newStackOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.rebuildOf` — the step's stack
  rewrite, as expressions.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.branchV`, `Geb.CobhamFold.foldStepV` — one step of the fold.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.decodeVAt` — the inverse of the layout at a window.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldGrowthV` — the growth the state layout's fixed part
  contributes.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldSemV`, `Geb.CobhamFold.foldExprV`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.foldExprOfV` — the scan, and the scan as a member of
  `Cobham.C`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.readoutWidthV`, `Geb.CobhamFold.outWordV`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.readOfV` — the readout's window, its output word, and the
  readout as an expression.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutOfV`, `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutExprV`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutSemV` — the readout composed onto the scan by
  `Geb.CobhamFold.comp1Of`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.algOfFixed` — a fixed-width carrier's algebra transported
  here.

## Main statements

* `Geb.CobhamFold.stackWordV_cons`, `Geb.CobhamFold.length_stackWordV` — the
  stack's layout and its length.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_dropEntriesOf_stackWordV`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_entryOf_stackWordV` — the primitives read the stack.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_dropEntriesOf_stackWordV_append`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_entryOf_stackWordV_append` — the same two reads at
  a stack layout followed by an arbitrary remainder, which each need the
  count to be within the stack.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.decodeState_stateWordV` — the dispatch window decodes the
  flag, the block and the count capped at the window.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_foldStepV` — a step of the expression computes a step
  of the fold scan.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldSemV_eq`, `Geb.CobhamFold.length_foldSemV_le` — the
  expression computes the fold scan's state word, and the recursion bound it
  satisfies under the linear-growth hypothesis.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_readOfV` — the readout's value at a state word.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.length_fold_le_of_growth` — an algebra lengthening by at most
  a constant per symbol folds a term to a value linear in its node count.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.potential_foldScanStep_le`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.potential_foldScanFinal_le`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stackSize_le_of_growth` — the same condition bounds the scan's
  potential `R.width * stackSize + c * |buf|`, and so discharges the
  linear-growth hypothesis `length_foldSemV_le` takes.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.potential_foldScanStep_le_of_invariant`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.potential_foldScanFinal_le_of_invariant`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stackSize_le_of_growth_of_invariant` — the same three with
  the growth condition assumed only of values satisfying a predicate the
  scan's stack carries, which an algebra duplicating its children's payloads
  needs; the unrestricted forms are these at the trivial predicate.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutSemV_eq` — the expression computes
  `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOut`, spelled by `outWordV`; with `foldOut_eq` this is
  `RankedAlphabet.parse` followed by the algebra morphism.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOut_algOfFixed` — at an algebra whose carrier stays within
  a fixed width, the fold this construction computes and the one the fixed-width
  construction computes agree, up to the encoding. It is a statement about the
  two algebras at the shared semantic layer, which each construction is
  separately proved to compute (`foldOutSemV_eq` here, `foldOutSem_eq` there).

* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldSemV_eq_eval`, `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutSemV_eq_eval` — the
  meanings read at the raw trees are the meanings the expressions carry.

## Implementation notes

Names here carry a `V` suffix where their fixed-width counterparts in
`Geb/Prototypes/Computability/CobhamFoldProto/Layout.lean` and
`Geb/Prototypes/Computability/CobhamFoldProto/Expr.lean` carry an `F` or, where
the fixed-width name came first, no suffix at all: the two constructions define
the same notions at a variable-width and at a fixed-width carrier, and the
suffix is what keeps them apart in one namespace.

### The state layout

```text
stateWordV R s = stateWord R (toScan s) ++ false :: stackWordV s.stack
```

The state word is the recognizer's — the liveness flag, the block slot, and the
pending count in unary — followed by a `false` sentinel and the stack, whose
entries are `Geb.CobhamFold.entryWord`'s self-delimiting spellings.

Two consequences. The pending count stays inside a constant dispatch window, so
the test `R.arity i ≤ depth` is still a bounded one and the branch family is
`Cobham.dispatchWidth R` wide — the recognizer's own width, independent of the
carrier. And the sentinel is required: an entry begins with its length in
unary, so without a `false` between the count and the stack the decoder's
`takeWhile` would run out of the count and into the first entry's prefix.

### Cost

Each primitive the step reads the stack with is itself a recursion whose step is
not constant. `Geb.CobhamFold.dropEntryOf`'s step applies `Cobham.pred`, itself
a `boundedRec`; `Geb.CobhamFold.takeEntryOf`'s step runs a fresh `dropEntryOf`
over the remaining word. Counting a `boundedRec`'s cost as the sum over its
levels of its step's cost, `dropEntryOf` is quadratic in its argument and
`takeEntryOf` cubic, so a fold's state-reading here is polynomial of a degree above
two rather than quadratic.

Nothing here measures a number of reduction steps, as
`Geb/Mathlib/Computability/Cobham/Tree.lean` records of its own subject; the
paragraph above is an analysis of the expression under one cost model, and a
machine evaluating it is not obliged to follow that model.

The accompanying lower bound rests only on the class's shape rather than on a
cost model: reading an unbounded field of the state requires a recursion over
the state, `boundedRec` being the class's only recursion, so no step reading
such a field is constant. It bears on this layout, whose steps do read one; it
does not exclude some other expression computing the same fold without reading
an unbounded field. It is an argument about the expression, not a theorem stated
here.

The algebra is an arbitrary member of the class and so carries whatever cost the
class admits, putting a fold above its algebra by whatever the state-reading costs.
The state-reading is therefore not what limits a fold: any cost the class admits at
all is reached by spending it inside the algebra. How far that goes is a
question about the class, not about this construction, and it is not settled
here — only the left-to-right inclusion of [Strahm2003] Theorem 1(2) is relied
on anywhere in this repository, and `docs/references.bib` records that the
equality fails read literally.

Space is what binds. The state holds every pending value, so a linear-space
reading forces a constant `c` bounding the pending values' total length by
`c * n`, which is the hypothesis `Geb.CobhamFold.length_foldSemV_le` takes.
That hypothesis is not an artifact of this construction: [Clote1999]'s
arithmetic analogue reads its class as one of functions of linear growth.

The dispatch is no wider here than at a fixed-width carrier, and narrower at
every positive carrier width; at `p = 0` the two coincide, which
`Geb.CobhamFold.dispatchWidthF_zero` states. The fixed-width dispatch reads the
stack, so its branch family is
`2 ^ (1 + R.width + (p + 1) * (R.maxArity + 1))`; here it reads only the flag,
the slot and the count, so the family is `2 ^ Cobham.dispatchWidth R` whatever
the carrier. This is a statement about the branch family alone: the completing
branch here carries a `rebuildOf` subtree no fixed-width branch does, and the
two expressions' sizes are not compared.

This is an equality of results only, and it relates the two algebras at the
shared semantic layer rather than the two expressions directly; each expression
is tied to that layer separately, by `foldOutSemV_eq` here and by
`Geb.CobhamFold.foldOutSem_eq` for the fixed-width construction. The two differ
in cost, though not as a constant-time step against a linear-time one: under the
model of § Cost neither construction has constant-time steps, `Cobham.casesOf`
dispatching through `Cobham.cond` and `Cobham.predIterOf` iterating
`Cobham.pred`, both `boundedRec` nodes over the state. What differs is the
degree, a fixed-width step being linear in the state where `takeEntryOf` is
cubic. -/
