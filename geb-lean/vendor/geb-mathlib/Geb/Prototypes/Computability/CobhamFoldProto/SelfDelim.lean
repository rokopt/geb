# Self-delimiting bitstrings in Cobham's class

A stack whose entries are bitstrings of varying length needs entries that
delimit themselves, and a step that reads one needs to parse it. This module
supplies the parsing primitives as expressions of Cobham's class.

An entry spelling the payload `u` is `List.replicate u.length true` followed by
`false` followed by `u`: a unary length prefix, read from the list's head, which
is the end a step of the outer scan pops from.

`Cobham.scan` lifts steps of arity one, applying them to the recursive value
alone. `dropUnaryOf`, `dropEntryOf` and `takeEntryOf` need the remaining word as
well,
which `Cobham.evalRec` supplies in slot zero of a step's environment, so `scan2`
takes its steps at arity two directly.

`takeEntryOf` is the one whose use of it is least avoidable. Its recursion
appends a bit at the *end* of the payload accumulated so far, which is not a
head operation; the `concat` generator supplies the append, and the appended bit is read
off the remaining word by `firstBitOf` after `dropEntryOf`. Without slot zero the
payload would not be extractable and the algebra could not be applied.

## Main definitions

* `Geb.CobhamFold.scan2` — the arity-two scan node as an expression;
  `Geb.CobhamFold.scan2Raw` itself lives with the scan combinators in
  `Geb/Prototypes/Computability/CobhamFoldProto/Bound.lean`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.entryWord` — the self-delimiting spelling of a payload.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.firstBitOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.unaryOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.takeUnaryOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.dropUnaryOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.dropEntryOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.takeEntryOf` — the parsing
  primitives.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.idOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.dropEntriesOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.entryOf` — the identity, and the primitives iterated to reach
  the `j`-th entry. The composition combinators they are built from live in
  `Geb/Prototypes/Computability/CobhamFoldProto/Bound.lean`.

## Main statements

* `Geb.CobhamFold.scan2Sem_nil`, `Geb.CobhamFold.scan2Sem_cons` — the arity-two
  scan on the empty word and on one bit.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_firstBitOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_unaryOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_takeUnaryOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_dropUnaryOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_dropEntryOf`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.stepWord_takeEntryOf` — what each primitive computes.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.take_succ_append_take_one` — a truncation splits at its
  last bit.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.takeEntrySem_entryWord`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.dropEntrySem_entryWord` — the payload and the remainder of a
  self-delimiting entry.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.two_mul_length_takeEntrySem_add_length_dropEntrySem_le` —
  the payload counted twice and the remainder fit inside the word.

* `Geb.CobhamFold.scan2Sem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at the raw tree is the
  meaning the expression carries.

## Implementation notes

Every primitive's value is no longer than its argument, so each takes
`Cobham.boundRaw 0` as its bound child: the recursion variable itself dominates.
The bounds are established over arbitrary words, not only over well-formed
entries, since `Cobham.RecBoundedValue` quantifies over every environment.

Each primitive recurses over the whole word, not over the entry it reads.
`Cobham.evalRec` recurses to the empty word whatever the value depends on, so
`dropEntryOf` touches every bit of its argument although, at an entry spelling
the payload `u`, the first `2 * u.length + 1` bits are what fix where its value
starts. Their steps are not constant either: `dropEntryOf`'s
applies `Cobham.pred`, itself a `boundedRec`, and `takeEntryOf`'s runs a fresh
`dropEntryOf` over the remaining word, so counting a `boundedRec`'s cost as the
sum over its levels of its step's cost makes `dropEntryOf` quadratic in its
argument and `takeEntryOf` cubic.

Nothing here measures a number of reduction steps, as
`Geb/Mathlib/Computability/Cobham/Tree.lean` records of its own subject; the
paragraph above analyses the expression under one cost model.

The accompanying lower bound rests only on the class's shape rather than on a
cost model: reading an unbounded field of the state requires a recursion over
the state, `boundedRec` being the class's only recursion. It is an argument
about the expression, not a theorem stated here.

That gives a dichotomy rather than a spectrum, in what a step reads rather than
in what it costs. A carrier whose values are bounded by a constant is the
fixed-width case — pad to that constant and dispatch on a constant window, and
no step reads an unbounded field. A carrier whose values are unbounded needs
entries of this shape, and every step reads one. There is no intermediate
regime, a bound of any constant `B` being the fixed-width case at width `B`.
Neither case has constant-time steps: reading even a bounded prefix of the state
goes through a `boundedRec` over the state.

Only `boundedRec` nodes carry a `Cobham.RecBoundedValue` obligation, `comp`'s
being vacuous, so composing these primitives imposes no further bound. This is
why `entryWord`'s spelling, which is longer than its argument, needs no growth
allowance: it is a composition, not a recursion.
